# Module 1 Final Project - KC dataset analysis


## Overview
The king county housing market is highly competitive, and we want to be the best real estate agent advisor in the area. To compete with our peers, we decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist us and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, we’ve come across the King County Housing data set which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Seattle communities. Our task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then used to estimate the best selling price for our client’s home.
